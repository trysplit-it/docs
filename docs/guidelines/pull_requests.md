# Making Pull Requests

- Always reference issues being closed using the `closes` keyword:

    ```
    closes #44
    ```

- Never merge your pull request without getting approval. This also will be explicitly disallowed through GitHub.

- Try not to push buggy code, especially if other people will branch from yours.
