# Our story

Split.it was started as a way to vanquish the mightiest dragon that our team had seen at our time at Johns Hopkins University: the notorious group chat scheduling spreadsheet. If you’re at a college or university, we’re almost certain that you’ve seen it too – the infamous travel spreadsheet that gets passed around every group chat, with phone numbers and emails and flight times. After some serious research (asking our friends), we realized that we could centralize this information and make it easily accessible and viewable. And, if we could manage to coordinate travel plans for flights, why not help with weekly grocery store runs, nights out in town, and any other purpose there is?
